1. Create a repo, "Continuous Integration" and clone it in local
# remember to clone with a PAT which has scope of 'workflow' also as cloning with a PAT without 'workflow' scope won't let us push CI/CD workflow.
2. Create one streamlit based python script.
3. Run it using command "streamlit run app.py"
# Services/Servers like Github Actions/ Jetkins/ TravisCI automate the CI flow.
4. To perform CI using Github Actions, add a folder ".github/workflows" and add ci.yaml script inside it.
# ci.yaml contains job setup(like trigger CI on any git push or pull request etc.), checkout to actions/checkout repo, python setup, dependencies installations and customized test running.
5. In the main repo folder, add _test.py, which contains automatic tests to be performed on app.py in CI using Github Actions.
6. Pushing this repo now will trigger Github Actions to automatically act as per ci.yaml, so push the changes of repo.
# On github website, Go to reposiotries -> Actions and there one can find executed tests.
7. Update ci.yaml to add checks for quality control using flake8. Then push the code.
8. Create a new branch "autoformatting_code" and update ci.yaml to add ruff installation to automatically fix most of the code formatting issues. Then push the code.
